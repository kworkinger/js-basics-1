// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.

let plannning = "Planning occurs as information and requirements are typically gathered from customers. A plan may include: resource allocation, capacity planning, project scheduling, cost estimation, and provisioning."
let analysisOfRequirements = "Requirements to be automated by the software are brought on through collaborative efforts of the architects, development teams, product managers and subject matter experts. A backlog may also be employed here."
let design = "In the design phase, architects and developers begin to implement the requirements in their software. Framework and design patterns are used to prepare a consistent development. The design may include rapid prototyping."
let implementation = "In this phase, the design is put into development via waterfall, sprint, or other common software development strategies. The software is developed and ready to begin testing."
let testingAndIntegration = "This phase checks and tests for code quality, unit testing, integration testing, performance testing, and security testing. It is then released and maintained."
let maintain = "Bugs and defects are fixed as feedback is received from the customer. The fix is carefully integrated so as not to create further defects."
